### Running the examples

1.  Ensure you have `yarn` installed.

Follow the instructions for your platform [here](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/).

2.  Install all dependencies:

```
yarn
```

3.  We execute the files in the terminal using `babel-node` which comes with `babel-cli`:

```
./node_modules/.bin/babel-node app.js
```
